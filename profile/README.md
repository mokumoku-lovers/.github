Hey, this is Moku-moku team! ðŸ‘‹
We are a global team who gathered together from Build@Mercari 2021, after the training we decided to build a Flashcard Language Learning platform to explore & learn more about Software Engineering.
You can find all the repos and source code here, the back-end is built in Golang with a micro-services architecture & the front-end is a React web application. ^^
